# This is the client part of a live chat React project.

The client is made in React with Typescript and Redux for state management.
The project is being hosted [here](https://happy-hermann-43378f.netlify.app/).
The server is hosted on Heroku's free tier, and because of that the first connection to the server might be slow.
